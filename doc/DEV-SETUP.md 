#Set up for IUTools development

## Clone iutools project

If you are reading this file, it means that you presumably already cloned the 
iutools project from Github. If not, you need to do so from this URL:

   https://github.com/alaindesilets/iutools.git
   
## Clone the java-utils project, or obtain its jars

The *iutools* project has a dependency on a project called *java-utils*. The 
sources for this project are  currently available only to NRC employees. This 
is something that will be remedied soon.

If you are an NRC employee, you can obtain those sources by cloning the 
following project:

   https://git.dt.nrc.ca/gitroot/java-utils.git

If you are NOT an NRC employee, you must procure the java-utils JARs 
from from an NRC partner and copy them to your maven repo under path:

    .m2/repository/ca/nrc/java-utils
   
If you have access to the `cyclosa.web.net` server, the jar files are under:

    /var/iutools/lib/java-utils
    
## Obtain corpora files

*iutools* requires a number of large data files which cannot be tracked on git. 

These are currently stored on server *cyclosa.web.net*, under the path:

    /var/iutools/data/data
   
Files and folders contained in that directory (compiled-corpuses, LanguageData, 
etc...) must be copied over to your local machine under path

    iutools/iutools-data/data
      
## The iutools modules

At this point you should be able do load the *iutools* project in your 
preferred IDE, and use it to modify, test and install its various modules. 

There are three modules in *iutools*:

- `iutools-data:` Data files required by the other two modules.
- `iutools-core:` Core algorithms and datastructures. Also, command-line 
     interface (CLI) to those core algorithms.
- `iutools-apps:` Web apps.

## Deploying the *iutools* web apps

Once you have compiled the `iutools-apps` module, you can deploy its apps on 
Tomcat.

Simply follow the instructions in the file
